headquarters with the deliberate intention of bringing the army around
to his side. In this he failed miserably.
His main support consisted of a number of officers, nearly all of
Prussian regiments, who formed themselves into two regiments and
placed themselves at his Majesty's disposal. To do anything with such
support was seen, of course, to be Gilbertian.
NEW YORK, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1918. TWENTY-FOUR PAGES.
During the night the Kaiser called the Crown Prince, Hindenburg,
and General Grüner to him, and the consultation lasted a couple of
hours. Both officers strongly pressed the Kaiser to bow to the inevit-
able, and Hindenburg informed him that any more delay in coming to a
decision to abdicate would certainly have the most terrible consequences
and lead to serious events in the army. For those consequences Hin-
denburg said he must refuse responsibility.
General
The Crown Prince, it is said, was the first to give way.
Gröner fully supported liindenburg's view, but when the conference
broke up the Kaiser remained unconvinced of the advisability of abdica-
tion. He is said to have come to his final decision an hour or so later,
after several communications had reached him from Berlin and after
another short and stormy talk with Hindenburg.
Meanwhile, his son-in-law, the Duke of Brunswick, for himself and

to include Field Marshal von

LONDON, Nov. 10-Emperor William signed his letter of abdica-

presence of Crown Prince Frederick William and Field Marshal Hinden-

with a shiver. Then he signed the paper, saying:
"It may be for the good of Germany."
The Emperor was deeply moved. He consented to sign the document
only when he got the news of the latest events in the empire.
The ex-Kaiser and former Crown Prince were expected to take
leave of their troops on Saturday, but nothing had then been settled
regarding their future movements.

BERNE, Nov. 10, (Associated Press.)-In an address to the
people, the new German Chancellor, Friedrich Ebert, says:
Citizens: The ex-Chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, in agreement
with all the Secretaries of State, has handed over to me the task of
liquidating his affairs as Chancellor. I am on the point of forming
a new Government in accord with the various parties, and will keep
public opinion freely informed of the course of events.
The new Government will be a Government of the people. It must
make every effort to secure in the quickest possible time peace for
the German people and consolidate the liberty which they have won.
The new Government has taken charge of the administration, to
preserve the German people from civil war and famine and to accom-

I know it will be difficult for some to work with the new men who
have taken charge of the empire, but I appeal to their love of the
people. Lack of organization would in this heavy time mean anarchy
in Germany and the surrender of the country to tremendous misery.
Therefore, help your native country with fearless, indefatigable work
for the future, every one at his post.
I demand every one's support in the hard task awaiting us. You
